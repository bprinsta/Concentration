# Concentration (Stanford University Course)

This app allows you to play the card game "Concentration", also known as "Memory" and "Match Up", on your iOS Device. The project was initially developed in Stanford's CS193p (Developing iOS Apps with Swift). I've since added additional features such as confetti and alerts to make the game more fun.
